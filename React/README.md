# React 

React combines HTML with JavaScript functionality into its own markup language called JSX. React also makes it easy to manage the flow of data throughout the application.

# Goal 
you'll learn how to create different React components, manage data in the form of state props, use different lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, and much more.

## Topics

1. Create a Simple JSX Element:
    - `const JSX = <h1>{ 'Hello JSX!' }</h1>;`

2. Create a Complex JSX Element:
    - ```
        const JSX = <div>
            <h1>Complex JSX</h1>
            <p>Elements</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paragraph One</li>
                <li>Paragraph Two</li>
                <li>Paragraph Three</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
      ```

3. Comment Somewhere:
    ` {/*  a comment somewhere */} `

4. Define an HTML Class in JSX
the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. For example, a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick. Likewise, onchange becomes onChange. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.

`<div className="myDiv"> `
